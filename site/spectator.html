      Spectator Mode
    </h2>
    <p>
      Spectator mode allows you to fly and be invincible, like in creative mode, and you can also phase through blocks. However, you cannot interact with the world in any way, 
      and other players will not be able to see you. As a result, you are only able to spectate the game, hence its name. Additionally, this mode is also useful for searching for
      underground structures, as when you are underground in spectator mode, you can still see everything above you.
