      Survival Mode
    </h2>
    <p>
      Survival mode is the most basic mode in Minecraft. This is the first version that existed in the game, and is also the game mode you will see people playing in most often. 
      In this mode, you can change the world around you by placing and destroying blocks, and can also interact with blocks, items, and creatures. If you take too much damage, 
      you will die, dropping all of your items on the spot where you died and reappearing at your spawn point, which means you have to travel to where you died to get them back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The player always spawns with 20 health by default, although this can be changed. You can take damage and lose health through a variety of ways, like being attacked by
      creatures, falling from high places, and suffocating. Once you reach 0 health, you will die. To avoid this, you can wear armor to reduce the amount of damage taken, or use 
      spells and food to get your health back.

      <h3>
        Hardcore Mode
      </h3>
      <p>
        Hardcore mode is exactly the same as survival mode, but with two big changes: the game is locked on its hardest difficulty setting, and death is permanent. This means that 
        if you die, there is no going back to retrieve your stuff, and your only options after dying are to either delete the world, or spectate it. Dying in this mode can be very
        heartbreaking, as there is no undoing what has happened. However, many people still choose to play this mode for the thrill of always being in grave danger.
