      Adventure Mode
    </h2>
    <p>
      This mode is for when you want someone to visit a world you have built, but you don't want them to destroy it. Players in this mode are not able to break or place blocks, 
      but they can still interact with things like buttons and doors, and they can still fight creatures and other players. This is the mode most commonly used for puzzle maps or 
      challenge courses posted online.
