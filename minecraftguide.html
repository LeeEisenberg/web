  1. Survival Mode
</b>
<p>
  Survival mode is the most basic mode in Minecraft. This is the first version that existed in the game, and is also the game mode you will see people playing in most often. In this mode, you can change the world around you by placing and destroying blocks, and can also interact with blocks, items, and creatures. If you take too much damage, you will die, dropping all of your items on the spot and reappearing at your spawn point, which means you have to go to where you died to get them back.

  1a. Hardcore Mode
  </b>
  <p>
    Hardcore mode is exactly the same as survival mode, but with two big changes: the game is locked on its hardest difficulty setting, and death is permanent. This means that if you die, there is no going back to retrieve your stuff, and your only options after dying are to either delete the world, or spectate it.

  2. Creative Mode
</b>
<p> 
  In this mode, you have no limits. You can infinitely fly, and you are invincible. This mode is for those who want to have fun building without the pressure of trying to survive at the same time, or the difficulty of getting the resources to build large structures. This mode allows you to have fun building whatever you want, free of the usual interruptions you would get from a normal survival game, like creature attacks or resource gathering.
</p>

  3. Adventure Mode
</b>
<p>
  This mode is for when you want someone to visit a world you have built, but you don't want them to destroy it. Players in this mode are not able to break or place blocks, but they can still interact with things like buttons and doors, and they can still fight creatures and other players.
</p>
<br><b>
  4. Spectator Mode
</b>
<p>
  Spectator mode allows you to fly and be invincible, like in creative mode, and you can also phase through blocks. However, you cannot interact with the world in any way, and other players will not be able to see you. As a result, you are only able to spectate the game, hence the name.
