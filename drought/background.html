                    Droughts can cause many health problems. Some of the health effects directly related to 
                    droughts can be clearly observed and measured in the short term. However, the slow 
                    escalation or prolonged nature of droughts can also lead to indirect health effects 
                    over a long period of time that are not always easy to predict or monitor.

                Shortages and poor water quality can have a negative impact on air quality, sanitation, hygiene, 
                and food and nutrition.

                People may face more health problems due to lack of adequate drinking water.

            <li>
                A decline in the quality of drinking water can lead to a range of sanitation problems, 
                while also potentially exacerbating the spread of disease.

                    Economic Impacts
                    <p>
                        The economic impact is mainly related to agriculture, timber industry, ship sales, 
                        power companies, water companies, and water-related businesses. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Farmers could face crop losses and additional irrigation costs, ranchers could pay 
                        more for animal feed and water, and agriculture-related businesses could lose business.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The timber industry has been affected by forest fires, and ship sales and aquaculture 
                        may not be able to sell goods.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hydroelectric companies may need to rely on other fuels, while power companies and 
                        water utilities may need to invest more to secure water supplies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Falling water levels could lead to difficulties in the water transport industry and 
                        people may have to pay higher food bills.

                        In November, the cost of vegetables from producers surged by 38% on a monthly basis, 
                        marking an increase of over 80% compared to the same month in 2021

                        The multifaceted impacts of drought on society include anxiety over economic losses, 
                        health problems related to water quality and flow problems:
